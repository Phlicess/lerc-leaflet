So, what *is* **[LERC](http:github.com/Esri/lerc)**?

> LERC is an open-source image format which supports rapid encoding and decoding for any pixel type. Users set the maximum compression error per pixel while encoding so the precision of the original input image is preserved (within user defined error bounds).

unrelatedly, *Lurch* is arguably a member of the [Addams family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurch_(The_Addams_Family))
